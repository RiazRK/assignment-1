                <h3>Know our Global Community</h3>
                <p>Global Communities began in 1952 as the Foundation for Cooperative Housing, a U.S. organization that helped build houses for people in need based on the cooperative model.
                Though our name has changed and our impact has grown to reach over 35 countries, our commitment to partnering with communities to bring about sustainable, positive change remains the same. In 2020, Global Communities merged with Project Concern International (PCI), a global development organization driving innovation from the ground up to enhance health, end hunger, overcome hardship and advance women and girls.Today, as one Global Communities, we work at the intersection of humanitarian assistance, sustainable development and financial inclusion to save lives, advance equity and secure strong futures.
